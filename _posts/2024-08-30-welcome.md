Hello, and welcome to my blog! I’m excited to finally launch this space where I’ll be sharing thoughts, ideas, and everything in between. This is my first post, and there’s no better way to kick things off than by talking about the platform behind this blog — the **Chirpy Jekyll Theme**.

## What to Expect from This Blog

I’m looking forward to sharing a variety of content, including:

- **Personal Projects**: Updates and insights on my personal projects and coding adventures.
- **Cybersec Write-ups**: Writeups about red & blue team oriented tasks and adventures.
- **News from ThreatVector**: Sharing insights from my company - [ThreatVector](https://www.threatvector.tech)

## Let’s Connect!

I’m excited to have you along for this journey! Feel free to leave comments, share posts, and connect with me on social media. If there’s anything specific you’d like me to cover, just let me know.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to seeing you in future posts. Here’s to the start of something new!

Stay tuned,
